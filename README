This project was occasioned by a problem at math.stackexchange.com about
counting latin squares, and in particular counting diagonal latin squares,
those with both main diagonal and anti-diagonal transversals.

http://math.stackexchange.com/q/92752/3111

I began by modifying some Prolog code I'd written in the past for generating
permutations and in particular for derangements and sudoku matrices, also a
kind of restricted latin square.

The code files in this project will have *.pro extensions.  Many Prolog tool
chains expect *.pl extensions, but unfortunately this is a matter of dispute
with the Perl community, who also claim that two letter designation.  I'm
giving in for now, succumbing to the temptations of syntax highlighting with
such programmer's text editors as jEdit.

All this code will be open sourced under the GPL3 license, with appropriate
notice to that effect in each source file.
